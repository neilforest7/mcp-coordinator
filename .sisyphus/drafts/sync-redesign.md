# Draft: Redesign Sync Architecture

## Requirements (Initial)
- Redesign Cross-Source Sync (Claude <-> OpenCode)
- Redesign Cross-Machine Sync (Local <-> Remote)
- Goal: Robust, Stable, Easy to Use

## Research Findings
- [Pending] Current implementation details
- [Pending] Best practices

## Open Questions
- What specific "instability" is the user facing?
- Is "Cross-Machine Sync" currently implemented at all? (PRD said V1.5)
- What does "easy to use" mean here? (One-click? Auto-sync? Visual diff?)
